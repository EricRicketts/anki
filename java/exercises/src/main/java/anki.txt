1.  CommentService class, DBCommentRepository class, and the EmailCommentNotificationProxy because the CommentSerivce
class is dependent on instance of each of those classes.  In turn the DBCommentRepository and EmailNotificationProxy
class are themselves dependencies.
2.  The Comment class does not have a dependency not is itself a dependency.  Interfaces, along with abstract classes
are not put into the Spring context because they cannot be instantiated and the Spring context needs objects to add
to the context.
